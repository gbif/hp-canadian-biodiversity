## Privacy Notices
The Government of Canada and BioMob are committed to providing visitors with websites that respect their privacy. This page summarizes the privacy policy and practices on BioMob's website.

- BioMob web pages do not automatically gather any specific personal information from you, such as your name, phone number or e-mail address. We would only obtain this type of information if you supply it by sending us an e-mail or registering in a secure portion of the site.
- All personal information created, held or collected by this department is protected under the federal _Privacy Act_. This means that at any point of collection you will be asked for consent to collect your information, and you will be informed of the purpose for which it is being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information.
- BioMob employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. This software receives and records the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer that has contacted our website, the date and time of the visit and the pages visited. We make no attempt to link these addresses with the identity of individuals visiting our site unless an attempt to damage the site has been detected.
- BioMob does not normally use "cookies" to track how our visitors use this site or to determine sites previously visited. The system will notify you before any cookies are used so that you may refuse them. (A "cookie" is a file that may be placed on your hard drive without your knowledge by a website to allow it to monitor your use of the site.)
- Information on individual visitors is used by BioMob employees who need to know the information in order to respond to your request or to ensure the security of this system. We only share the information you give us with another government department if your inquiry relates to that department. We do not use the information to create individual profiles, nor do we disclose this information to anyone outside the federal government.

Questions or comments regarding this policy, or the administration of the _Privacy Act_ in BioMob may be directed to the Privacy Co-ordinator by e-mail, [canada.gbif@gmail.com](mailto:canada.gbif@gmail.com). If you are not satisfied with our response to your privacy concern, you may wish to contact the [Office of the Privacy Commissioner](http://www.privcom.gc.ca/index_e.asp).

## Conditions for Use of Data
### Disclaimers
- Data are provided on an "as is" basis -no responsibility by the network or by the caretakers of the original data is accepted for uses or misuses.
- Data are not to be used on a for-profit basis - use of the data for commercial or for-profit applications are permitted only via written permission from the managers of the data network and from the component data caretakers.
- Data are provided on an end-user basis - that is, data are provided to users, but are not to be passed on to third parties or otherwise redistributed.
- Proper acknowledgment of the data network and source institutions is expected; in textual form, the following format should be used: "Biodiversity data were drawn from the distributed data network entitled Species Analyst, a project of the North American Biodiversity Information Network, and participating institutions." Acknowledgment of individual institutions should also be included.
- Data are provided under the understanding that their use will be generally consistent with the philosophy of not causing detriment to wild species.
Data are provided in this facility under the general, overarching principle of free and open access to biodiversity information and technology.

### Provisos
- _Issues of data quality_ - Although interested in assisting data caretakers to improve data under their care, this data network serves simply to make information available. We refer users with special concerns regarding data precision or quality to the original data caretakers. Areas of special concern include taxonomic determinations and geographic referencing.
- _Use of negative information_ -Biodiversity data generally constitute positive information only; that is, absence of a record does not always mean absence of a particular species from a particular point in space and time. Because biodiversity sampling is notoriously spotty, biased, and incomplete, understanding the positive-only nature of the data is critical to their proper understanding.
- _General_ -Neither the creators of this biodiversity information network nor the institutions that it links guarantees either the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the data or information provided, or the reliability and functionality of the computer tools provided, and neither accepts any liability in this regard.
