## Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS)

[ITIS](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/9ca92552-f23a-41a8-a140-01abaa31c931#description) is a catalogue of common and 
scientific names and their synonyms of species of North America and the world.

Search result pages for individual species include the species nomenclature, synonyms, common names and the taxonomic 
hierarchy (genus, order, family, etc.). In addition, links to resources automatically search on the pertinent terms for 
the species you select. You can [browse the ITIS catalogue on GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/species/101683523?root=true).

The catalogue is also available [here](https://www.itis.gov/).
