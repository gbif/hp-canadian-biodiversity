## Rationale

**Biodiversity** underpins the functioning of ecosystems on which people depend. It provides essential products such as safe food, clean water, clean air, and fuel. It provides essential supporting and regulating services such as oxygen production, climate regulation, and soil nutrient cycling. It also provides essential cultural and public services such as well-being and spiritual health as identified by the World Health Organization’s One Health approach. This underpins the **need for Canadians to have timely access to high quality, comprehensive information about biodiversity**.

Free and open access to all the available information on biodiversity for users in government, academia, and non-profit and private sectors  safeguards and modernizes our ability to: 
* manage our natural resources sustainably
* respond and adapt more quickly to environmental changes
* ensure that essential ecological services are maintained
* conserve species-at-risk
* assess the impact of invasive species


## Mission

*To openly share, facilitate discovery and encourage the use of the best available knowledge of Canadian biodiversity in support of evidence-based decision making.*
